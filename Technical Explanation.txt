## Technical Explanation

In my implementation, the `recursive_case` function serves as the primary mechanism for generating fractal patterns using recursion. This function simulates the growth of a tree by drawing branches at calculated angles and lengths. 

At each recursion step, the code:
- Draws a line segment from `start_point` to `end_point`, where the endpoint is determined using trigonometric calculations (`cos` and `sin`) based on the current angle and length.
- Reduces the `length` by a randomly chosen factor to create variation in branch sizes.
- Splits the branch into a set number of new branches (`branches`), each with a modified angle to simulate natural spreading.
- Calls itself recursively, decreasing the `depth` by 1 until it reaches the base case (`depth <= 0`), at which point recursion stops.

This recursive method ensures that each branch spawns multiple smaller branches, aiming for a fractal tree where each iteration adds finer details, mimicking natural tree growth.
