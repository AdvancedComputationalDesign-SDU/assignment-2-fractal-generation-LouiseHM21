Fractal Image 1 (2D_FractalTree1.png)
    Parameters:
angle_offset: 30°
length_multiplier: 0.5
branches: 3
depth: 4
    Observations:
- Showcasing the initial 2D fractal tree
- Symmetry in the tree
- Not much control over the fractal pattern
- Very unnatural looking
- Lacking in fullness

Fractal Image 2 (2D_FractalTree2.png)
    Parameters:
angle_offset: 30°
length_multiplier: 0.5
branches: 3
depth: 4
   Observations:
- The same fractal tree as in the previous image where a color gradient is added according to the recurtion depth

Fractal Image 3 (2D_FractalTree3.png)
    Parameters:
angle_offset: 45°
length_multiplier: 0.8
branches: 2
depth: 6
 Observations:
- Wider/fuller fractal tree due to the increased angle which makes it look more natural than before
- symmetrical tree which is still very unnatural

Fractal Image 4 (2D_FractalTree4.png)
    Parameters:
angle_offset: random with interval [-50,50]
length_multiplier: 0.8
branches: 2
depth: 6
    Observation:
- The random angle removed the symmetrical aspect of the fractal tree
- still looks unnatual and lacking in fullness

Fractal Image 5 (2D_FractalTree5.png)
    Parameters:
angle_offset: random with interval [0,30]
length_multiplier: 0.8
branches: 2
depth: 6
    Observation:
- the different interval of the random angle makes the fractal tree look more natural
- the fractal tree is lacking fullness

Fractal Image 6 (2D_FractalTree6.png)
    Parameters:
angle_offset: random with interval [0,45]
length_multiplier: random with interval [0.6,0.8]
branches: 2
depth: 6
    Observation:
- The randomness in both the angle and lenght increases the natural look
- Still looks bare and lacking in fullness

Fractal Image 7 (2D_FractalTree7.png)
    Parameters:
angle_offset: random with interval [0,60]
length_multiplier: random with interval [0.5,0.8]
branches: 2
depth: 6
line_width: 10
    Observation:
- Introducing a line thickness to the branches according to the recurtion depth increases the natural look of the tree
- the wider angle interval makes the tree look unnatually wide

Fractal Image 8 (2D_FractalTree8.png)
    Parameters:
angle_offset: random with interval [0,30]
length_multiplier: random with interval [0.7,0.8]
branches: 2
depth: 10
line_width: 8
    Observation:
- the larger recurtion depth gives a more natural look
- the fractal tree look much tall than its width

Fractal Image 9 (2D_FractalTree9.png)
    Parameters:
angle_offset: random with interval [0,30]
length_multiplier: random with interval [0.8,0.9]
branches: 3
depth: 8
line_width: 8
    Observation:
- Looks wider/fuller and more natural with more braches

Fractal Image 10 (2D_FractalTree10.png)
    Parameters:
angle_offset: random with interval [0,30]
length_multiplier: random with interval [0.6,0.9]
branches: 4
depth: 7
line_width: 10
    Observation:
- The fractal tree in much fuller/wider but looking less natural with the increase to 4 branches
