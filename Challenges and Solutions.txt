## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge**: Calculating the angle_offset correctly.
  - **Solution**: I drew a few sample branches by hand and used trigonometry to find the right angles.

- **Challenge**: Organizing the code clearly.
  - **Solution**: I kept different parts (base_case, draw_tree_branch, and recursive_case) as separate functions so I could focus on one part at a time and make the code easier to read.

- **Challenge**: Making the tree look natural and organic.
  - **Solution**: This was not fully perfect, but adding some randomness to the branch lengths and angles helped. Using different line_width for branches based on depth also made the tree look better.
